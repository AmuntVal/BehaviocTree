# BehaviocTree

Implemented the the behavior tree in the Unity Editor.
Implemented the hit and run(attack the player while moving) function


Additional Function: Flee function
When the health of the robot is below 50%, it will not chase the player anymore. Instead, it will try to escape and flee from the player. 
The Attack-while-Moving function still works while fleeing, it will still fire at the player.

All these functions works perfectly in the Unity Editor, but in the built .exe file they are all gone.
Other students have met with this problem as well, and we asked for help in the wechat group, yet we didn't get much help :(
